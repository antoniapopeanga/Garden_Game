# Game presentation
A hedgehog is lost, and the player's mission is to rescue it by navigating through various gardens.<br>
Each garden is represented by a map with cells and doors, some of which are locked.<br>
The gardens are inhabited by hornets, and the player, represented as a gardener, must avoid their stings while collecting bonuses like insecticide bombs and apples for energy boosts.<br>
The gardener's energy depletes with movement and can be replenished by resting, but getting stung by hornets reduces energy.<br>
The goal is to avoid running out of energy while navigating through the gardens and rescuing the hedgehog.<br>
